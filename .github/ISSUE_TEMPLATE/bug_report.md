<!-- If your issue is related to ICONS 
- Purple and black checkerboards are QT's way of signalling an icon doesn't exist
  - FIX: Configure a QT6 or Icon Pack in DMS Settings that has the icon you want
  - Follow the [THEMING](https://danklinux.com/docs/dankmaterialshell/icon-theming) section to ensure your QT environment variable is configured correctly for themes.
  - Once done, configure an icon theme - either however you normally do with gtk3 or qt6ct, or through the built-in settings modal. -->
